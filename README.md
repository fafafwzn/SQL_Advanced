# SQL_Advanced

This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy. All the projects is from the "Analyze Real Data with SQL" course and "Advanced SQL" course.

## Project 1: Usage Funnels with Warby Parker
Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.
In this project, you will analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the funnels and the tables that you are given:
Quiz Funnel:
•	survey
Home Try-On Funnel:
•	quiz
•	home_try_on
•	purchase
This project was a collaboration with Warby Parker’s Data Science team (thank you!) and uses fictional data.
The preview of the tables are as below.

## Project 2: Calculating Churn Rates
Four months into launching Codeflix, management asks you to look into subscription churn rates. It’s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing.
The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users. They provide you with a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels.
The dataset provided to you contains one SQL table, subscriptions. Within the table, there are 4 columns:
•	id - the subscription id
•	subscription_start - the start date of the subscription
•	subscription_end - the end date of the subscription
•	segment - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to
Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.
The preview of the table is as below.

## Project 3: Climate Change
To practice what you’ve learned about window functions, you are going to use climate data from each state in the United States. A labeled map of the United States can be found here.

These data will show the average annual temperature for each state – this is the average temperature of every day in all parts of the state for that year.
For this project, you will be working with one table:
•	state_climate
The preview of the table is as below.
