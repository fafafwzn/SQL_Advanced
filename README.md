# SQL_Advanced

This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy. All the projects is from the "Analyze Real Data with SQL" course and "Advanced SQL" course.

## Project 1: Usage Funnels with Warby Parker
Warby Parker is a transformative lifestyle brand with a lofty objective: to offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price while leading the way for socially conscious businesses. Founded in 2010 and named after two characters in an early Jack Kerouac journal, Warby Parker believes in creative thinking, smart design, and doing good in the world. For every pair of eyeglasses and sunglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need.
In this project, you will analyze different Warby Parker’s marketing funnels in order to calculate conversion rates. Here are the funnels and the tables that you are given:
Quiz Funnel:
•	survey
Home Try-On Funnel:
•	quiz
•	home_try_on
•	purchase
This project was a collaboration with Warby Parker’s Data Science team (thank you!) and uses fictional data.
The preview of the table is as below.
